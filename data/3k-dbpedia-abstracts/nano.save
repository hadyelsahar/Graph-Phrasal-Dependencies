Aside from "The Simpsons", Smith has recorded few voice over parts, only commercials and the film "We're Back!
Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy "Waiting For Ophelia", which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.
Smith was married to actor Christopher Grove from 1990 to 1992 and Daniel Erickson from 2002 to 2008.
During the first season of "Herman's Head", Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists.
She released a children's book titled "I, Lorelei" in 2009 and her story "The Race" was included in the book "Just Humor Me".
Smith was born Martha Maria Yeardley Smith on July 3, 1964, in Paris, France.
Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., United States, in 1966, where he became "The Washington Post"'s first official obituary editor.
Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution.
Smith has stated: "I've sounded pretty much the same way since I was six.
After appearances in a number of school plays she joined the local Arena Stage theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of "Peter Pan".
She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's play "The Real Thing" alongside Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.
The film was a box office bomb and critically panned, although Smith "thought it would be the movie that launched my career.
And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died."
When filming was over, she rejoined "The Real Thing" before being out of work for six months.
However, the following year she played Connie in Stephen King's "Maximum Overdrive" , noting it was "truly a dreadful film but I had a great part in it."
Smith moved to Los Angeles, California in 1986 on the "semi-promise" of a part in a TV film.
They just don't realize how much impact they have on an impressionable actor — and all actors are impressionable."
From then on, she decided to "just sort of build a wall around myself," to cope with the disappointment of not getting a part.
In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of "Living On Salvation Street", for which she was paid $14 for each performance, "Boys and Girls/Men and Women" and "How the Other Half Loves", and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the Showtime series "Brothers".
She appeared in the films "The Legend of Billie Jean" and "Ginger Ale Afternoon" as "trailer-park girls."
She later spoke of her regrets of appearing in the latter in her one-woman show "More".
She has voiced Lisa since 1987, beginning with "The Simpsons shorts" on "The Tracey Ullman Show".
Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Lisa's brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high.
Smith later recalled "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'"
She denies rumours that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voiceover work.
Pietila stated that, having seen her in "Living on Salvation Street", Smith was always her preferred choice.
Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts.
Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in "Last Tap Dance in Springfield" and Lisa, Jr. in " .
During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices.
However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.
The issue was resolved a month later, and Smith earned $250,000 per episode.
After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors received approximately $400,000 per episode.
Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 25 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.
Despite her world famous role, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind, saying "it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice."
In a 2009 interview with "The Guardian" she commented: "It's the best job ever.
I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom "The Simpsons" has bought me in my life."
Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 but felt it was not worth anything, saying "there’s part of me that feels it wasn’t even a real Emmy."
The Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations.
However, Smith says "if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson."
The show's creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa: "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character.
There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.
Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode "Lisa's Substitute", as able "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic."
From 1991 to 1994, alongside "The Simpsons", Smith was one of the lead cast members in the sitcom "Herman's Head" as Louise.
Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on "Dharma & Greg", and Penny in two episodes of "Dead Like Me".
Smith has also appeared in "Phil of the Future" and "Teen Angel".
Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's "City Slickers" earned her "more attention than all [her] previous roles combined," and taught her "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees."
In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film "Just Write".
Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's "Toys" and James L. Brooks' "As Good as It Gets".
Brooks, who is also executive producer of "The Simpsons", had cast Smith in his 1994 film "I'll Do Anything" but her part was cut.
Aside from "The Simpsons", Smith has recorded few voice over parts, only commercials and the film "We're Back!
She "had a voice over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [on auditions] all the time, but it never really came to anything.
Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case."
In 2004, Smith performed her own Off-Broadway one-woman show entitled "More" at the Union Square Theatre in New York City.
Directed by Judith Ivey, the play is about her mixed feelings over the success of "The Simpsons", her parents, her relationships and her struggles with bulimia.
"The New York Times" critic Margo Jefferson called it an "appealing if overlong show", adding that "The career narrative needed shortening.
This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint the best parts of "More."
It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved.
It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full."
She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.
Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy "Waiting for Ophelia", which was released in 2009.
She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003.
Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she "believe[d] in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: "You can support art even if it's not going to make a zillion dollars."
In 2011, Smith starred as Ms. Miller in the movie "The Chaperone" alongside Triple H and Ariel Winter.
She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted for six years and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing once again irreconcilable differences.
In a 1997 interview with "The Daily Targum", Smith stated "I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to," and that she is a "private" actress.
In 2009 she commented that, "People have said to me that I'm unassuming.
She noted "It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory."
During the first season of "Herman's Head", Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists.
The book "Just Humor Me" includes a story, "The Race", written by Smith.

She obtained her breakthrough role in "Salome, Where She Danced" , produced by Walter Wanger, who described her as "the most beautiful girl in the world."
Success followed in films such as "Criss Cross" and "The Captain's Paradise" .
Her film career reached its peak when director Cecil B. DeMille cast her as Sephora, the wife of Moses, her most prominent role, in his biblical epic "The Ten Commandments" .
After her lead performance in "Band of Angels" and supporting role in "McLintock!"
, she played Lily Munster, the wife of Herman Munster, in the CBS sitcom "The Munsters" .
Margaret Yvonne Middleton was born on September 1, 1922, in West Point Grey , British Columbia.
She was the only child of William Middleton, an Australian-born salesman, and Marie DeCarlo , a French-born aspiring actress of Sicilian and Scottish origin.
Her mother ran away from home at 16 to become a ballerina; after several years working as a shop girl, she married in 1924.
She then lived with her grandparents, Michele "Michael" de Carlo , who was born in Messina, Sicily, and Margaret Purvis , who was born in Scotland.
When De Carlo was ten her mother enrolled her in the Jean Roper School of the Dance in Vancouver.
By the time she entered grade school she found her strong singing voice brought her the attention she longed for.
De Carlo was taken to Hollywood, where her mother enrolled her in dancing school.
De Carlo and her mother made several trips to Los Angeles until 1940, when she was first runner-up to "Miss Venice Beach".
She had been dancing for Granlund only a short time when she was arrested by immigration officials and deported to Canada, but in January 1941, Granlund sent a telegram to US immigration officials pledging his sponsorship of De Carlo in the U.S., and affirmed his offer of steady employment, both requirements to reenter the country.
Seeking contract work in the movies, she abruptly quit the Florentine Gardens after less than a year, landing a role as a bathing beauty in the 1941 "Harvard, Here I Come".
Other roles were slow to follow, and De Carlo took a job in the chorus line of Earl Carroll.
During World War II she performed for U.S. servicemen and received many letters from GIs.
A critic from the "Los Angeles Times" reviewed it saying that the "dancing of Yvonne de Carlo is especially notable".
In December 1941 she was dancing in the revue "Glamour Over Hollywood" at Florentine Gardens.
Being a skilled horserider, she also appeared in a number of West Coast rodeos.
De Carlo's earliest screen appearances were in Columbia Pictures, including the feature "Harvard, Here I Come!"
She also sang and danced in a three-minute Soundies musical, "The Lamp of Memory" , shown in coin-operated movie jukeboxes, and later released for 16mm home movie showings and television by Official Films.
She also appeared as a Native American "princess" in an independently produced version of "The Deerslayer" released in 1943 by Republic Pictures.
De Carlo was spotted dancing at a Hollywood nightclub by a Paramount talent scout, who signed her to the studio as a back up Dorothy Lamour – what the "New York Times" later dubbed a "threat girl... for when Dotty wanted to break away from saronging".
But De Carlo was ambitious and wanted more; "I'm not going to be just one of the girls", she would say.
and arranged for her to be screen-tested and interviewed for the role of Tremartini in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Story of Dr. Wassell" ; it was announced she would play a key role.
She wasn't cast in the end but DeMille promised to "make it up" to her on another film "in the future."
De Carlo was set to replace Dorothy Lamour in "Rainbow Island" but Lamour changed her mind about playing the role.
De Carlo received her big break in September 1944 when she was chosen over a reported 20,000 girls to play the lead role in "Salome, Where She Danced" , a Walter Wanger production in Technicolor.
Wanger later claimed he spotted De Carlo when looking at footage for another actor in which De Carlo also happened to appear.
Another source says 21 Royal Canadian Air Force bombardier students who loved her as a pinup star campaigned to get her the role.
De Carlo later said this was done at her behest; she took several pictures of herself in a revealing costume and got two childhood friends from Vancouver, Reginald Reid and Kenneth Ross McKenzie, who had become pilots, to arrange their friends to lobby on her behalf.
Though not a critical success, it was a box office favorite, and the heavily-promoted De Carlo was hailed as an up-and-coming star.
In his review for the film, Bosley Crowther of the "The New York Times" wrote: "Miss De Carlo has an agreeable mezzo-soprano singing voice, all the 'looks' one girl could ask for, and, moreover, she dances with a sensuousness which must have caused the Hays office some anguish.
The script, however, does not give her much chance to prove her acting talents."
"Salome" was released by Universal who signed de Carlo to a long-term contract.
She was used by the studio as a backup star to Maria Montez, and indeed stepped into a role rejected by Montez when she starred in "Frontier Gal".
She followed this up with "Song of Scheherazade" and "Slave Girl", which, like her previous two movies for Universal, was in Technicolor.
De Carlo wanted to act in different types of movies and was given a small role in "Brute Force".
She was then cast in her first important role opposite Burt Lancaster in the film noir "Criss Cross" .
In that respect, she is right in step with most everything else about "Criss Cross"."
However, Universal preferred to cast de Carlo in more conventional fare – "Black Bart" , "Casbah" and "River Lady" .
She made three movies in 1949 and 1950, "The Gal Who Took the West", "Buccaneer's Girl" and "The Desert Hawk", all directed by Frederick de Cordova.
When De Carlo was in England making "Hotel Sahara" in early 1951, she asked Universal for a release of her contract even though she still had three months to go; the studio agreed.
After that, she signed to make one film a year for Universal for three years, but actually did not return to the studio until 1955.
Trained in opera and a former chorister at St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver, when she was a child, De Carlo possessed a powerful contralto voice.
In order to expand her appeal she began frequently singing on television and trained in opera.
In 1951 she was cast in the role of Prince Orlovsky in a production of the opera "Die Fledermaus" at the Hollywood Bowl.
The part led to other roles in "The Ford Television Theatre", "Shower of Stars", "Schlitz Playhouse of Stars", "Bonanza", "Screen Directors Playhouse", "Burke's Law", "Follow the Sun" , "Adventures in Paradise", "The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.
", "The Name of the Game" and "The Virginian" among others.
She starred in the British comedy "The Captain's Paradise" , as one of two wives a ship captain keeps in separate ports.
Crowther described her in the film as "wonderfully candid and suggestive of the hausfrau in every dame."
In 1954, after the success of "The Captain's Paradise", she expressed a desire to do more comedy: "I've had my share of sirens and am happy to get away from them, no matter what the part.
Just to look pretty on the screen as a romantic lead is probably all right, but – so what?
I'd much rather do something in a good Western provided there's plenty of action.
In September 1954, director Cecil B. DeMille cast her as Sephora, the wife of Moses , in his biblical epic "The Ten Commandments" .
She prepared extensively for the role, taking weaving lessons at the University of California, Los Angeles and shepherding lessons in the San Fernando Valley.
Months before filming began, she had worked on the part with a drama coach.
Her performance was well received by film critics, described as "notably good" by Bosley Crowther.
In his autobiography, DeMille explained why he decided to cast De Carlo as Moses' wife: "I cast Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, the wife of Moses, after our casting director, Bert McKay called my attention to one scene she played in "Sombrero", which was a picture far removed in theme from "The Ten Commandments", I sensed in her a depth, an emotional power, a womanly strength which the part of Sephora needed and which she gave it."
De Carlo released an LP record of standards called "Yvonne De Carlo Sings" on Masterseal Records in 1957.
This album was orchestrated by future film composer John Williams under the pseudonym "John Towner."
Her last notable screen appearances were in the Civil War drama "Band of Angels" , with Clark Gable and Sidney Poitier; the Italian biblical epic "The Sword and the Cross" , with Jorge Mistral and Rossana Podestà; and the western comedy "McLintock!"
De Carlo was in debt by 1964 when she signed a contract with Universal Studios to perform the female lead role in "The Munsters" opposite Fred Gwynne.
She was also the producers' choice to play Lily Munster when Joan Marshall, who played the character , was dropped from consideration for the role.
When De Carlo was asked how a glamorous actress could succeed as a ghoulish matriarch of a haunted house, she replied simply, "I follow the directions I received on the first day of shooting: 'Play her just like "Donna Reed".'"
She sang and played the harp in at least one episode of "The Munsters".
After the show's cancellation, De Carlo reprised the role as Lily Munster in the Technicolor film "Munster, Go Home!"
Of the sitcom and its cast and crew, she said: "It was a happy show with audience appeal for both children and adults.
It was a happy show behind the scenes, too; we all enjoy working with each other."
Years later, in 1987, she said: "I think Yvonne De Carlo was more famous than Lily, but I gained the younger audience through "The Munsters".
Butch Patrick who played Eddie Munster said in a 2013 interview with "Rockcellar" magazine: "I met with Yvonne DeCarlo, who replaced Joan Marshall, the actress in the pilot.
They changed the character name from 'Phoebe' to 'Lily' and Happy Derman [from the pilot] was out and I was in and cast as "Eddie Munster" on The Munsters [...] Yvonne would be a maternal influence.
She’d be a mom because my mom wasn’t around so she’d be a matriarch, not only on the show but when I’d see her outside of the makeup on Mondays and Tuesdays.
After 1967, De Carlo became increasingly active in musicals, appearing in off-Broadway productions of "Pal Joey" and "Catch Me If You Can".
In early 1968 she joined Donald O'Connor in a 15-week run of "Little Me", staged between Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas.
Her defining stage role was as "Carlotta Campion" in Stephen Sondheim's musical, "Follies" in 1971-1972.
Playing a washed-up star at a reunion of old theater colleagues, she introduced the song "I'm Still Here", which would become well-known.
She had a small cameo role in a television film remake of "The Munsters", "Here Come the Munsters" in 1995.
Her final film appearance was in the 1995 television film "The Barefoot Executive", a Disney Channel remake of the 1971 film of the same name.
De Carlo's name was linked with a number of people through her career, including Howard Hughes and Robert Stack.
In 1954 she told a journalist: "I think it is wonderful to work.
I really like to delve deeply into the characters and the stories in order to make the most of each part I play.
I will have to meet an exceptional and understanding person, indeed, before I think of marriage.
De Carlo married stuntman Robert Drew Morgan, whom she met on the set of "Shotgun", on November 21, 1955.
Morgan lost his left leg after being run over by a train while filming "How the West Was Won" .
De Carlo and Morgan filed a $1.4 million lawsuit against the studio, claiming her husband was permanently disabled.
Her son Michael died in 1997; causes were unknown, although a Santa Barbara Police report contains concerns about possible foul play.
De Carlo was a Republican who campaigned for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Gerald Ford.
She later became a resident of the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, where she spent her last years. Yvonne Hughes Yvonne Hughes was a dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies and an actress in silent motion pictures.
She had roles in "Lawful Larceny", "Zaza", "Big Brother", "A Society Scandal", and "Monsieur Beaucaire".
On December 26, 1950, Hughes was murdered in the New York City hotel room of Birger Nordkvist, a Swedish apple picker who worked for a western New York cider firm.
Earlier that night, Nordkvist got into a cab driven by John McDonald, who had lived with Hughes for fourteen years.
McDonald offered to take him to the Ashland Hotel, where he kept a room.
Nordkvist met Hughes, who demonstrated some old dance routines for him, and they drank beer through the night and into the next morning; all the while, McDonald was driving his taxi.
After Hughes rebuffed Nordkvist's advances, Nordkvist strangled her by tying his handkerchief around her throat and stuffing a silk scarf into her mouth.
Nordkvist was arrested in Utica, New York where he went after leaving the hotel. She is best known for her role as Daisy Carter on "The Young and the Restless".
Zima was born in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, the daughter of Dennis and Marie.
Her surname means "winter" in Polish and comes from her maternal grandfather, who was of Polish descent.
Zima's breakthrough role was as Caitlin in the film "The Long Kiss Goodnight" .
She played Daisy on "The Young and the Restless" on and off between 2009 and 2012. ZaSu Pitts ZaSu Pitts was an American actress who starred in many silent dramas and comedies, transitioning successfully to mostly comedy films with the advent of sound films.
She may be best known for her performance in Erich von Stroheim's epic silent film, "Greed".
Eliza Susan Pitts was born in Parsons, Kansas, to Rulandus and Nelly Pitts; she was the third of four children.
Her father, who had lost a leg while serving in the 76th New York Infantry Regiment in the Civil War, had settled the family in Kansas by the time ZaSu was born.
The names of her father's sisters, Eliza and Susan, were purportedly the basis for the nickname "ZaSu", i.e.
Although the name is commonly mispronounced or , or , in her 1963 book "Candy Hits" , Pitts herself gives the correct pronunciation as "Say Zoo" , recounting that Mary Pickford had predicted, "[M]any will mispronounce it", and adding, "How right [she] was."
In 1903, when she was nine years old, her family moved to Santa Cruz, California, to seek a warmer climate and better job opportunities.
Pitts made her stage debut in 1914–15 doing school and local community theater in Santa Cruz.
Going to Los Angeles in 1916, at the age of twenty-two, she spent many months seeking work as a film extra.
Marion cast Pitts as an orphaned slavey in the silent film, "The Little Princess" , starring Pickford.
Years later, she was the leading lady in Erich von Stroheim's "Greed" .
Based on her performance, von Stroheim labeled Pitts "the greatest dramatic actress".
He also featured her in his films "The Honeymoon" , "The Wedding March" , "War Nurse" and "Walking Down Broadway", released as "Hello, Sister!"
Pitts' popularity grew following a series of Universal one-reeler comedies and earned her first feature-length lead in King Vidor's "Better Times" .
The following year she married her first husband, Tom Gallery, with whom she was paired in several films, including "Bright Eyes" , "Heart of Twenty" , "Patsy" and "A Daughter of Luxury" .
In 1924, the actress, now a reputable comedy farceuse, was given the greatest tragic role of her career in Erich von Stroheim's -hour epic "Greed" .
The surprise casting initially shocked Hollywood, but showed that Pitts could draw tears with her doleful demeanor as well as laughs.
Having been extensively edited prior to release—the final theatrical cut ran just over two hours—the movie failed initially at the box office, but has since been restored to over four hours and is considered one of the greatest films ever made.
Pitts enjoyed her greatest fame in the 1930s, often starring in B movies and comedy short films, teamed with Thelma Todd.
Her stock persona made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films.
She starred in a number of Hal Roach short films and features, and co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with Slim Summerville.
Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she was relegated to comedy roles.
A bitter disappointment was when she was replaced in the classic war drama "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Beryl Mercer after her initial appearance in previews drew unintentional laughs, despite her intense performance.
She had viewers rolling in the aisles in "Finn and Hattie" , "The Guardsman" , "Blondie of the Follies" , "Sing and Like It" and "Ruggles of Red Gap" .
In 1936 and 1937 she portrayed Hildegarde Withers in two movies, succeeding Edna May Oliver as the spinster sleuth, but they were not well received.
In the 1940s, she found work in vaudeville and on radio, trading banter with Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, W.C. Fields, and Rudy Vallee, among others.
Pitts' activities on radio included playing Miss Mamie Wayne on the soap opera "Big Sister".
She appeared several times on the earliest "Fibber McGee and Molly" show, playing a dizzy dame constantly looking for a husband.
In 1944, Pitts tackled Broadway, making her debut in the mystery, "Ramshackle Inn".
The play, written expressly for her, did well, and she took the show on the road in later years.
Post-war films continued to give Pitts the chance to play comic snoops and flighty relatives in such fare as "Life with Father" , but in the 1950s she started focusing on television.
This culminated in her best known series role, playing second banana to Gale Storm on CBS's "The Gale Storm Show" () in the role of Elvira Nugent , the shipboard beautician.
In 1961, Pitts was cast opposite Earle Hodgins in the episode "Lonesome's Gal" on the ABC sitcom, "Guestward, Ho!
In 1962, Pitts appeared in an episode of CBS's "Perry Mason", "The Case of the Absent Artist".
Her final role was a switchboard operator in the Stanley Kramer comedy "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" .
Gallery, an actor, became a well-known Los Angeles boxing promoter and later a TV executive.
The couple had two children: Ann Gallery and Donald Michael "Sonny" Gallery , whom they adopted and renamed after the 1926 death of his mother and Pitts' friend, silent film actress Barbara La Marr.
In 1933, she married John Edward "Eddie" Woodall, with whom she remained until her death.
Declining health dominated Pitts' later years, particularly after she was diagnosed with cancer in the mid-1950s.
She continued to work, however, appearing on television and making a brief appearance in "The Thrill of It All" and in "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World".
She died June 7, 1963, aged 69, in Hollywood and was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City.
Pitts wrote a book of candy recipes, "Candy Hits by ZaSu Pitts", which was published posthumously in 1963.
ZaSu Pitts was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960.
In 1994 her importance as a silent film star was affirmed when she was honored with her image on a United States postage stamp along with luminaries such as Rudolph Valentino, Clara Bow and Charlie Chaplin as part of The Silent Screen Stars stamp set, designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.
In Parsons, Kansas, there is a star tile at the entrance to the Parsons Theatre to commemorate her.
In the film "Never Give a Sucker an Even Break", W.C. Fields asks his niece, played by Gloria Jean, "Don't you want to go to school?
Actress Mae Questel, who performed character voices in Max Fleischer's Popeye the Sailor cartoons, reportedly based the fluttering utterances of Olive Oyl on Pitts.  Zachary Taylor Zachary Taylor was the 12th President of the United States, serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850.
Before his presidency, Taylor was a career officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of major general.
Taylor's status as a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican-American War won him election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs.
His top priority as president was preserving the Union, but he died seventeen months into his term, before making any progress on the status of slavery, which had been inflaming tensions in Congress.
Taylor was born into a prominent family of planters who migrated westward from Virginia to Kentucky in his youth.
He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812.
He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832.
His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname "Old Rough and Ready".
In 1845, as the annexation of Texas was underway, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area in anticipation of a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas–Mexico border.
The Mexican–American War broke out in May 1846, and Taylor led American troops to victory in a series of battles culminating in the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Monterrey.
He became a national hero, and political clubs sprang up to draw him into the upcoming 1848 presidential election.
The Whig Party convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket, despite his unclear platform and lack of interest in politics.
He won the election alongside former U.S. Representative Millard Fillmore of New York, defeating Democratic candidates Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler.
As president, Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union.
Debate over the slave status of the large territories claimed in the war led to threats of secession from Southerners.
Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery.
To avoid the question, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.
Taylor died suddenly of a stomach-related illness in July 1850, ensuring he would have little impact on the sectional divide that led to civil war a decade later.
Taylor was born on November 24, 1784, on a plantation in Orange County, Virginia, to a prominent family of planters of English ancestry.
He is inconclusively believed to have been born at the home of his maternal grandfather, Hare Forest Farm.
He was the third of five surviving sons in his family and had three younger sisters.
His father, Richard Taylor, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the American Revolution.
Taylor was a descendant of Elder William Brewster, the Pilgrim colonist leader of the Plymouth Colony, a "Mayflower" immigrant, and one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact; and Isaac Allerton Jr., a colonial merchant and colonel who was the son of "Mayflower" Pilgrim Isaac Allerton and Fear Brewster.
Leaving exhausted lands, his family joined the westward migration out of Virginia and settled near what developed as Louisville, Kentucky, on the Ohio River.
Taylor grew up in a small woodland cabin before his family moved to a brick house with increased prosperity.
The rapid growth of Louisville was a boon for Taylor's father, who came to own throughout Kentucky by the start of the 19th century; he held 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings.
There were no formal schools on the Kentucky frontier, and Taylor had a sporadic formal education.
His early letters show a weak grasp of spelling and grammar, and his handwriting was later described as "that of a near illiterate".
In June 1810, Taylor married Margaret Mackall Smith, whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville.
"Peggy" Smith came from a prominent family of Maryland planters; she was the daughter of Major Walter Smith, who had served in the Revolutionary War.
On May 3, 1808, Taylor joined the U.S. Army, receiving a commission as a first lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment.
He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress in response to the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war.
Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs.
His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances.
Over the next several years, he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville.
He bought a plantation in Louisville for $95,000 that had 83 slaves attached to it, as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200.
In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory, where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled.
In only a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison.
During the War of 1812, in which U.S. forces battled the British Empire and its Indian allies, Taylor successfully defended Fort Harrison in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh.
Later that year he joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions: the first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site, where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of Wild Cat Creek.
In spring 1814, he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard.
That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson, the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley.
Upon Howard's death a few weeks later, Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to Saint Louis.
Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815, he resigned from the army.
For two years, Taylor commanded Fort Howard at the Green Bay, Michigan Territory, settlement.
In April 1819 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and dined with President James Monroe.
In late 1821, Taylor took the 7th Infantry to Natchitoches, Louisiana, on the Red River.
On the orders of General Edmund P. Gaines, they set out to locate a new post more convenient to the Sabine River frontier.
By the following March, Taylor had established Fort Jesup, at the Shield's Spring site southwest of Natchitoches.
That November he was transferred to Fort Robertson at Baton Rouge, where he remained until February 1824.
In late 1826 he was called to Washington, D.C., to work on an Army committee to consolidate and improve military organization.
In the meantime he acquired his first Louisiana plantation and decided to move with his family to Baton Rouge as their home.
In May 1828, Taylor was called back to action, commanding Fort Snelling in Michigan Territory on the northern Mississippi River for a year, and nearby Fort Crawford for a year.
After some time on furlough, when he expanded his landholdings, Taylor was promoted to colonel of the 1st Infantry Regiment in April 1832.
Taylor campaigned under General Henry Atkinson to pursue and later defend against Chief Black Hawk's forces throughout the summer.
The end of the war in August 1832 signaled the end of Indian resistance to U.S. expansion in the area, and the following years were relatively quiet.
During this period Taylor resisted the courtship of his 17-year-old daughter Sarah Knox Taylor and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, the future President of the Confederate States of America.
He respected Davis but did not approve of his daughter becoming a military wife, as he knew it was a hard life for families.
Davis and Sarah Taylor married in June 1835, but she died three months later of malaria contracted on a summer visit to Davis' sister in St. Francisville, Louisiana.
By 1837, the Second Seminole War was underway when Taylor was directed to Florida.
He defeated the Seminole Indians in the Christmas Day Battle of Lake Okeechobee, which was among the largest U.S.–Indian battles of the nineteenth century.
Gen. Thomas Jesup stepped down and placed Taylor in command of all American troops in Florida, a position he held for two years.
His reputation as a military leader was growing, and with it, he began to be known as "Old Rough and Ready."
'Recommending the importation of Cuban bloodhounds to hunt down the poor Indians' Taylor was widely condemned.
After his long-requested relief was granted, Taylor spent a comfortable year touring the nation with his family and meeting with military leaders.
During this period, he began to be interested in politics and corresponded with President William Henry Harrison.
He was made commander of the Second Department of the Army's Western Division in May 1841.
The sizable territory ran from the Mississippi River westward, south of the 37th parallel north.
Stationed in Arkansas, Taylor enjoyed several uneventful years, spending as much time attending to his land speculation as to military matters.
In anticipation of the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which had established independence in 1836, Taylor was sent in April 1844 to Fort Jesup in Louisiana.
He served there until July 1845, when annexation became imminent, and President James K. Polk directed him to deploy into disputed territory in Texas, "on or near the Rio Grande" near Mexico.
Taylor chose a spot at Corpus Christi, and his Army of Occupation encamped there until the following spring in anticipation of a Mexican attack.
Violence broke out several weeks later, when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton's men were attacked by Mexican forces near the river.
Polk, learning of the Thornton Affair, told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun.
That same month, Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of Palo Alto and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma, defeating the Mexican forces, which greatly outnumbered his own.
These victories made him a popular hero, and within weeks he received a brevet promotion to major general and a formal commendation from Congress.
The national press compared him to George Washington and Andrew Jackson, both generals who had ascended to the presidency, although Taylor denied any interest in running for office.
"Such an idea never entered my head," he remarked in a letter, "nor is it likely to enter the head of any sane person."
In September, Taylor inflicted heavy casualties upon the Mexican defenders at the Battle of Monterrey.
The city of Monterrey had been considered "impregnable", but was captured in three days, forcing Mexican forces to retreat.
Taylor was criticized for signing a "liberal" truce, rather than pressing for a large-scale surrender.
Afterwards, half of Taylor's army was ordered to join General Winfield Scott's soldiers as they besieged Veracruz.
Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna discovered, through an intercepted letter from Scott, that Taylor had contributed all but 6,000 of his men to the effort.
His remaining force included only a few hundred regular army soldiers, and Santa Anna resolved to take advantage of the situation.
Santa Anna attacked Taylor with 20,000 men at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847, leaving around 700 Americans dead or wounded at a cost of over 1,500 Mexican.
Outmatched, the Mexican forces retreated, ensuring a "far-reaching" victory for the Americans.
In recognition of his victory at Buena Vista, Taylor was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati on July 4, 1847.
Taylor's father had been an Original Member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.
Unfortunately for the younger Taylor, the Virginia society had disbanded shortly before the elder Taylor's death, which prevented him from succeeding to his father's "seat" in the Society.
Taylor was a member of the Aztec Club of 1847, Military Society of the Mexican War.
Taylor remained at Monterrey until late November 1847, when he set sail for home.
While he would spend the following year in command of the Army's entire western division, his active military career was over.
In December he received a hero's welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and his popular legacy set the stage for the 1848 presidential election.
In his capacity as a career officer, Taylor had never reportedly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time.
He thought of himself as an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836.
He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar could be easily grown there through a plantation economy.
He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems.
Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.
Well before the American victory at Buena Vista, political clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President.
His support was drawn from an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk.
By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and it became clear that his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy.
Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist.
Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat.
Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion.
This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it.
Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements.
The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above all else.
For his Vice Presidential nominee the convention chose Millard Fillmore, a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and had been a contender for Henry Clay's Vice Presidential nominee in the 1844 election.
Fillmore's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs, who were furious at the election of a slaveowning southerner; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket.
Taylor continued to minimize his role in the campaign, preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views.
His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, a friend and early political supporter, and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts.
Taylor defeated Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, and Martin Van Buren, the Free Soil candidate.
As president-elect, Taylor kept his distance from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849.
He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs.
While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking to play a role in his administration.
While he would not appoint any Democrats, Taylor wanted his cabinet to reflect the nation's diverse interests, and so apportioned the seats geographically.
He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration, offering him the crucial seat of Secretary of State, but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky to which he had just been elected.
Taylor settled instead on Senator John M. Clayton of Delaware, a close associate of Crittenden's.
Taylor began his trek to Washington in late January, a journey rife with bad weather, delays, injuries, sickness—and an abduction by a family friend.
Taylor finally arrived in the nation's capital on February 24 and soon met with the outgoing President Polk.
The incumbent Democrat held a low opinion of Taylor, privately deeming him "without political information" and "wholly unqualified for the station" of President.
Taylor spent the following week meeting with political elites, some of whom were unimpressed with his appearance and demeanor.
With less than two weeks until his inauguration, he met with Clayton and hastily finalized his cabinet.
Taylor's term as president began Sunday, March 4, but his inauguration was not held until the following day out of religious concerns.
His inauguration speech discussed the many tasks facing the nation, but presented a governing style of deference to Congress and sectional compromise instead of assertive executive action.
Throughout the summer of 1849, Taylor toured the northeastern U.S., to familiarize himself with a region of which he had seen little.
He spent much of the trip plagued by gastrointestinal illness and returned to Washington by September.
As Taylor took office, Congress faced a battery of questions related to the Mexican Cession, comprising three major territories acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War: California, New Mexico, and Utah.
It was unclear which of the acquisitions would achieve statehood and which would remain federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress.
While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor had no particular bias toward the southern faction of Congress which sought to maintain its right to slavery.
As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with northern abolitionists such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.
In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands.
The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.
The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution.
King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.
The question of the New Mexico–Texas border was unsettled at the time of Taylor's inauguration.
The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders, despite having no significant presence there.
Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress.
The Texas government, under newly instated governor P. Hansborough Bell, tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.
The Latter Day Saint settlers of modern-day Utah had established a provisional State of Deseret, an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress.
The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory.
To alleviate the Mormon population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.
He recapped international events and suggested several adjustments to tariff policy and executive organization, but such issues were overshadowed by the sectional crisis facing Congress.
He reported on California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and "should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character".
The policy report was prosaic and unemotional, but ended with a sharp condemnation of secessionists.
It had no effect on Southern legislators, who saw the admission of two free states as an existential threat, and Congress remained stalled.
Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked diplomatic experience, and came into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics.
Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration.
As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered little in the way of aid.
A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration.
In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic.
While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.
Throughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with Narciso López, the Venezuelan radical who led repeated filibustering expeditions in an attempt to conquer the island of Cuba.
While López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal.
They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted.
They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S. Arguably the Taylor administration's definitive accomplishment in foreign policy was the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, regarding a proposed inter-oceanic canal through Central America.
While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, and the construction of such a canal was decades away from reality, the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position.
For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua.
Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua.
The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.
Senate Majority Leader Henry Clay took a central role as Congress debated the statehood question.
While his positions had some overlap with Taylor's, the president always maintained his distance from Clay.
With assistance from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, Clay developed his landmark proposal, the Compromise of 1850.
The proposal allowed statehood for California, giving it independence on the slavery question, while the other territories would remain under federal jurisdiction.
This would include the disputed parts of New Mexico, although Texas would be reimbursed for the territory.
Slavery would be retained in the District of Columbia, but the slave trade would be banned.
Meanwhile, a strict Fugitive Slave Law would be enacted, bypassing northern legislation which had restricted Southerners from retrieving runaway slaves.
Tensions flared as Congress negotiated and secession talks grew, culminating with a threat from Taylor to send troops into New Mexico to protect its border from Texas, with himself leading the army.
Taylor also said that anyone "taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang ... with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico."
The omnibus law was a major step forward but ultimately could not pass, due to extremists on both sides.
No great compromise reached Taylor's desk during his presidency; instead, his last days were overshadowed by the Galphin affair.
Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War George W. Crawford had served as a lawyer.
He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid at the time of the American Revolution.
The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration.
Taylor's Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Reverdy Johnson, finally signed off on the payment in April 1850.
To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another.
A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment.
Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.
On July 4, 1850, Taylor reportedly consumed raw fruit and iced milk after attending holiday celebrations and a fund-raising event at the Washington Monument, which was then under construction.
Over the course of several days, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment.
His doctor "diagnosed the illness as cholera morbus, a flexible mid-nineteenth-century term for intestinal ailments as diverse as diarrhea and dysentery but not related to Asiatic cholera," the latter being a widespread epidemic at the time of Taylor's death.
The identity and source of Taylor's illness are the subject of historical speculation , although it is known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness.
On July 8, Taylor remarked to a medical attendant: I should not be surprised if this were to terminate in my death.
I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency.
God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty.
Taylor was interred in the Public Vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., from July 13, 1850, to October 25, 1850.
His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents were buried on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as "Springfield" in Louisville, Kentucky.
Because of his short tenure, Taylor is not considered to have strongly influenced the office of the Presidency or the U.S.
Some historians believe that Taylor was too inexperienced with politics, at a time when officials needed close ties with political operatives.
Despite his shortcomings, the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty affecting relations with Great Britain in Central America is "recognized as an important step in scaling down the nation's commitment to Manifest Destiny as a policy."
While historical rankings of Presidents of the United States have generally placed Taylor in the bottom quarter of chief executives, most surveys tend to rank him as the most effective of the four Presidents from the Whig Party.
He was the third of four Whig presidents, the last being Fillmore, his successor.
Taylor was also the second president to die in office, preceded by William Henry Harrison who died while serving as President nine years earlier, as well as the only President elected from Louisiana.
In 1883, the Commonwealth of Kentucky placed a fifty-foot monument topped by a life-sized statue of Taylor near his grave.
By the 1920s, the Taylor family initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery.
The Commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project, turning the half-acre Taylor family cemetery into .
On May 6, 1926, the remains of Taylor and his wife were moved to the newly constructed Taylor mausoleum, made of limestone with a granite base and marble interior, nearby.
The US Post Office released the first postage stamp issue honoring Zachary Taylor on June 21, 1875, 25 years after his death.
In 1938, Taylor would appear again on a US Postage stamp, this time on the 12-cent Presidential Issue of 1938.
Taylor's last appearance on a US postage stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on the AMERIPEX presidential issue.
After Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln, Zachary Taylor was the fifth American president to appear on US postage.
He is the namesake for several names and places throughout the United States, including: He was also the namesake for architect Zachary Taylor Davis.
Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories persisted into the twentieth century.
In 1978, Hamilton Smith based his assassination theory on the timing of drugs, the lack of confirmed cholera outbreaks, and other material.
In the late 1980s, Clara Rising, a former professor at University of Florida, persuaded Taylor's closest living relative to agree to an exhumation so that his remains could be tested.
The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner on June 17, 1991.
Samples of hair, fingernail, and other tissues were removed, and radiological studies were conducted.
The remains were returned to the cemetery and reinterred, with appropriate honors, in the mausoleum.
Neutron activation analysis conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed no evidence of poisoning, as arsenic levels were too low.
The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted "cholera morbus, or acute gastroenteritis", as Washington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been contaminated.
Any potential for recovery was overwhelmed by his doctors, who treated him with "ipecac, calomel, opium, and quinine , and bled and blistered him too."
Relying on interviews and reports by forensic pathologists, he argues that the procedure used to test for arsenic poisoning was fundamentally flawed.
A 2010 review concludes: "there is no definitive proof that Taylor was assassinated, nor would it appear that there is definitive proof that he was not."It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain.
In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 790,017.
The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,113,111.
It is the only metropolitan area in Croatia with a population of over one million.
Zagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day.
The oldest settlement in the urban area of the city is Andautonia, a Roman settlement in the place of today's Ščitarjevo.
The name "Zagreb" is mentioned for the first time in 1094 at the founding of the Zagreb diocese of Kaptol, and Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242, whereas the origin of the name still remains a mystery in spite of several theories.
In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor, Janko Kamauf, and in 1945 it was made the capital of Croatia when the demographic boom and the urban sprawl made the city as it is known today.
Zagreb has a special status in the Republic of Croatia's administrative division and is a consolidated city-county , and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts, most of them being at low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Sljeme mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse.
The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia.
Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies and almost all government ministries.
Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city.
Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Western Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia.
It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting and entertainment events.
The oldest settlement in the urban area of Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now Šćitarjevo, which dates back to the 1st century AD.
The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centers: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by farmers and merchants.
Gradec and Zagreb were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jelačić, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jelačić Square in his honour.
During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city.
The name Zagreb appears to have been first recorded in 1134 in a document relating to the establishment of the Zagreb bishopric around 1094, although the origins of the name Zagreb are less clear.
The Croatian word "zagrabiti" translates approximately to "to scoop", which forms the basis of some legends.
One Croat legend says that a Croat ban was leading his thirsty soldiers across a deserted region.
He drove his sabre into the ground in frustration and water poured out, so he ordered his soldiers to dig for water.
The idea of digging or unearthing is supported by scientists who suggest that the settlement was established beyond a water-filled hole or "graba" and that the name derives from this.
According to another old legend, a city governor was thirsty and ordered a girl named Manda to take water from Lake Manduševac , using the sentence: "Zagrabi, Mando!"
Some sources suggest that the name derives from the term 'za breg' or 'beyond the hill'.
The hill may well have been the river bank of the River Sava , which is believed to have previously flowed closer to the city centre.
Another possible origin is the term "za grabom", meaning "behind the moat", as the city was heavily fortified since its beginnings.
During Austria-Hungary, Zagreb was more commonly known outside Croatia by its Austrian German exonym "Agram".
Finally, is to be noted the etymological relation of the word "Zagreb" with the city's Ancient Greek name "Agranon."
This type of relation is common in other modern cities too, that were recorded in Ancient Greek maps Early Zagreb.
The history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese.
Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medveščak stream.
Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia.
As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.
There were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec.
Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.
At the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery.
In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.
During the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague.
In 1776, the royal council moved from Varaždin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Varaždin and Karlovac general command.
In the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.
The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks.
After the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.
The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities.
This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas.
Since 1 January 1877, the Grič cannon is fired daily from the Lotrščak Tower on Grič to mark midday.
Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Peščenica in the east and Črnomerec in the west were created.
After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.
In the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent — the largest demographic boom in the history of the town.
In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting out of Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.
During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by the Nazi Germany and Italians.
The area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II.
After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb , originally called "Južni Zagreb" .
The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements.
The cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river.
The largest industrial zone in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region.
During the 1991–1995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage.
In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two Zagreb rocket attacks which killed seven civilians.
An urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zaprešić, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica.
Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.
The climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate , near the boundary of the humid continental climate.
The average daily mean temperature in winter is around +1 °C and the average temperature in summer is .
Snowfall is common in the winter months, from December to March, and rain and fog are common in autumn .
Highest recorded temperature ever was in July 1950, and lowest was in February 1956.
Zagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population.
The official 2011 census counted 792,324 residents, although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.
Zagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.2 million inhabitants, as it includes the Zagreb County.
In 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, although it remains the administrative center of both.
The majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population .
The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs , 8,119 Bosniaks , 4,292 Albanians , 2,755 Romani , 2,132 Slovenes , 1,194 Macedonians , 1,191 Montenegrins , and a number of other smaller communities.
Since 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided in 17 city districts: Settlements.
The city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area - there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lučko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately.
Most important branches of industry are: production of electric machines and devices, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, food and drink processing.
Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, and an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterannean and the Balkans.

In the 2000s, the city council approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.
In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lanište expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.
Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4-8 floors tall.
Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lanište or Kajzerica.

Until a few years ago, all Croatian highways either started or ended in Zagreb.
The highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, and forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb.
The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest.
The A1 starts at the Lučko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split .
Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.
The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing.
It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe.
Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Goričan border crossing.
The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country.
The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary are linked with truck routes.
The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region ; a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city.
Traffic jams and daytime parking space are a great problem in the wider city centre area during the rush hour.
Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots .
The busiest roads are the main east-west arteries, former Highway "Brotherhood and Unity", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagrebačka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre.
The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day.
Zagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than .
In downstream order, these are: There are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mičevec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zaprešić , and the other near Ivanja Reka .
Two additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.
Public transportation in the city is organized in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail .
The public transportation company ZET operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidized by the city council.
The national rail operator Croatian Railways runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.
Taxis are readily available through a network of around 3000 taxi vehicles, but this type of Zagreb's public transport hadn't been particularly popular among the residents until the end of the 2000s due to the monopoly of only one taxi company.
In early 2010, numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.
Zagreb has an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city.
The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since.
The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.
An ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Končar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by TŽV Gredelj, has recently been finished.
The new "TMK 2200", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.
In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east-west direction and to the southern districts.
A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014.
The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called "Samoborček" was closed in the 1970s.
Zagreb Airport , known as 'Pleso Airport' is the main Croatian international airport, a drive southeast of Zagreb in the suburb of Pleso.
The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft.
The airport had slightly less than 2.5 million passengers in 2012, but in September 2013 a new terminal is to be built and the airport will be able to receive more than 5 million passengers after the end of construction.
It is home to sports airplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase.
A third, small grass airfield, Buševec, is located just outside Velika Gorica.

Readers became privy to the inner workings of the institution by reading Zelda's "The Name Above The Door".

She appeared in a vaudeville in November, where her performance was well received: "In appearance the buoyant Miss O'Neal has become quite ladylike after a sojourn in, of all places to acquire that, Hollywood.
Naturally she has lost some of her gamin quality, but she is sufficiently old-style in her renditions of "Button Up Your Overcoat" and "Varsity Drag", and delights her audience with an excellent act."
She opened in "The Gang's All Here" in February 1931, but the show received poor notices–"Seldom has a lavish musical stage production struggled so clumsily to reconcile a satiric book with the antics of clowns who ask for nothing so much as space and freedom on the stage.
O'Neal and Bushell relocated to London in 1932, where she established a second stage career.
When the "New York Times" reported in December 1934 that she was announced for the cast of "Jack O'Diamonds" that would tour England before opening in London, it commented: "That should relieve a lot of people who haven't been able to locate Miss O'Neal since the days of "The Gang's All Here" in 1931".
The play opened to good notices in London in February 1935, and the "Telegraph" wrote of O'Neal: "She's that very rare thing–an attractive woman who doesn't mind making a fool of herself."
Following their divorce, they appeared in the same show at least once, though they did not appear together on stage.

After working on minor stages for several years, she performed on Broadway in a Tony-nominated performance in 1961's "Look We've Come Through".
She scored with a pair of small but noteworthy performances in the films "Pay or Die" and "Splendor in the Grass".
In the 1960s/70s she was active in supporting roles in film and television, and won an Emmy for her performance as a sinister gypsy on an episode of "Kojak" .
She was a regular in the sitcom "The Girl With Something Extra" and the medical drama "Doctors' Hospital".
During the early 1970s, she created the role of Ellie Jardin on the CBS soap, "Where the Heart Is", until her character was killed off in 1972.
She appeared in roles as diverse as "The Exorcist III" , and the offbeat 1999 film, "The Eden Myth", which would prove to be her last feature film role for the next decade.
For several years in the 80s, Lampert appeared on-screen as the spokesperson for Goya Beans.
After a ten-year absence from films, Lampert returned to acting in supporting roles in two films: "The Hungry Ghosts" and "Zenith" .
In March 2010, she married broadcaster and novelist Jonathan Schwartz in New York City.  Zoë Tamerlis Lund Zoë Tamerlis Lund , also known as Zoë Tamerlis and Zoë Tamerlaine, was an American musician, model, actress, author, producer, political activist and screenwriter.
She was best known for her association in two films with film director Abel Ferrara: "Ms. 45" , in which she starred, and "Bad Lieutenant" , for which she wrote the screenplay.
She was born Zoë Tamerlis on February 9, 1962 to mother Barbara Lekberg, a sculptor.
At a young age, Lund was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp.
"I could write a concerto with 17 violins that could be very powerful, but film works on a more visceral level where I can go into the collective audience and make sure my point gets across."
Lund said in an interview that she had a lot of input manifesting the character: "In the beginning stages of the film, the only material that existed was vague descriptions of several scenes.
Being that my face is on camera, without dialogue, for something like 98% of the time, I was involved very much.
As to the film being pro-woman, I go beyond that by saying that the film is as much pro-woman as it is pro-garment worker, whatever."
"In any case, Miss Tamerlis's exoticism is of the fashion-magazine kind, as opposed to the real kind," Janet Maslin wrote in her review of the film.
"So she isn't very frightening, and neither is much of what she does."
Although it was not an immediate success, "Ms. 45" eventually became a cult film in later years.
Not wanting to become part of what she called "Abel's stable" she marked her own career path.
Three years after "Ms. 45" was released in 1981, Lund got her second chance to star in a movie, this time in a role that required her to play two different roles.
In it he cast Lund as a wannabe starlet who is murdered on film by a fallen director portrayed by Eric Bogosian, who then finds a lookalike to take her place in the movie he decides to make around the snuff footage.
As the starlet, Lund's voice was dubbed by another actress, meaning it wasn't until an hour into her second movie that audiences finally got to hear her distinctly New Yorker inflections .
Lund also appeared in an episode of "Miami Vice", which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and titled "".
She later appeared in "The Houseguest" and Temístocles López's "Exquisite Corpses" .
Despite not wanting to become part of what she calls "Abel's stable", Lund collaborated with Ferrara again on "Bad Lieutenant" , which she co-wrote.
Lund also agreed to appear in the film, playing the woman who helps Harvey Keitel's title character freebase some heroin.
Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more.
The vampire speech – which is crucial to the Lieutenant – was written two minutes before it was shot.
The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes.
She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go."
Lund said in an interview that "Bad Lieutenant" was the most personal film she had ever acted in.
As a director, Lund made two shorts: "The Innocent Tribunal" and "Hot Ticket" .
Lund worked on unproduced screenplays about famous junkies such as John Holmes and Gia Carangi.
Lund attempted to publish several novels, including "Curfew: USA" and "490: A Trilogy and Kingdom for a Horse".
A film adaptation of "Curfew: USA" and the screenplay about Holmes were both projects that Ferrara had considered filming.
Other unproduced screenplays that have been credited as Lund's works included "Last Night of Summer" and "Free Will and Testament".
Although she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary "The Self-Destruction of Gia".
According to Abel Ferrara: "...one time in the 90s, we were going to try to do Pasolini's story but only with Zoe as Pasolini; a female director living the life that Pasolini lived."
However, her death led to a fifteen year hiatus with the project until Ferrara's film "Pasolini" was released.
In 1996, Lund also wrote the first draft of "New Rose Hotel" .
"She loved heroin, she was killed by heroin," Ferrara said on her heroin addiction.
"...Zoe was one of these people who thought heroin was the greatest thing in the world, and she did until the day she died.
She was down on coke, down on everything, but you know, heroin was the elixir of life for her."
"I've known a lot of serious drug users," Richard Hell, a friend of Lund's, recalled in 2002, "but Zoë was Queen.
I have always had a certain increasing awareness of religion...I do believe that the Gospel is the ultimate story.
What is amazing about the book is that over the millennia, the gospel has become so refined to the point where the Christ story does present a very refined and highly charged model for the search for truth.
We can use the book as a basis for our own path to spirituality and grace."
Both David Scott Milton and Jonas Mekas claim that Laurot co-wrote most of the screenplay of "Bad Lieutenant".
After Laurot's death in 1993, and before Lund's in 1999, the latter bequeathed the manuscript of a novel the former had written to Mekas.
They lived together in an apartment located on 10th Street, and according to Paul Rachman, the Lunds reportedly owned "dozens of roaming pet rats."
Although they never got divorced, Lund and her husband separated in 1997 when the former moved to Paris where she lived with "her new boyfriend" until her death in 1999.
Lund died in Paris on April 16, 1999 of heart failure, due to extended cocaine use, which replaced her long-term heroin use after her move to Paris in 1997.
In the early 2010s, "American Hardcore" director Paul Rachman made two documentary shorts about Lund's life: "Zoe XO" and "Zoe Rising" .
In the former short, Robert Lund discusses their relationship, while in the latter Zoë's mother Barbara Lekberg focuses more on her childhood.
