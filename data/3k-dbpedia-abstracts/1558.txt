Iberian Union is the anachronistic historical designation of the political union of the Crown of Portugal with the other Iberian crowns - through a dynastic union, under the Spanish branch of the Habsburg monarchy, after the War of the Portuguese Succession - that included all the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire, from 1580 to 1640 .
